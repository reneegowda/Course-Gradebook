# Course-Gradebook
This repository contains a Java project that implements a gradebook manager using nested lists to represent tables of student grades. The project emphasizes object-oriented design, abstract data types, iterators, and defensive programming, while giving hands-on practice with dynamic arrays and doubly-linked lists.
